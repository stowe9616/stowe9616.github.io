## [Employment and Estimated Salary in the Data Science Field](/sample_page)

The field of data has been rapidly changing in recent years.
Job titles such as Data Analyst, Data Scientist, and Data Engineer may represent synonymous or completely different roles at various companies. I wanted to look at job listings for these three job titles and compare salary, skills etc. 

### Approach and Summary
The goal of this project is to pull data from Glassdoor (Kaggle source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/data-analyst-jobs) and compare Data Analyst, Data Scientist and Data Engineer job listings in terms of salary, job skills and job locations. I used RStudio for the data analysis and PowerBI for data visualization. I utilized basic regression models to determine how salary changes with the change in title, skills, location etc.

### Data and Data Cleaning
After getting the data from Kaggle, I removed any data that didn't fall under the 3 main job titles. After this, I created dummy variables for a list of 16 popular data science skills on whether or not they were included in the job description of the listing. Other data cleaning occurred as well including removing null values, duplicates and irrelevant columns. Below, is the distribution of salaries for the 3 job titles.

There are different skills associated with each of the job titles. SQL tends to be common across all three job titles and Python is extremely common for Data Scientists and Data Engineers. Excel was mentioned mostly in job listings for Data Analysts but is likely expected for Data Engineer and Data Scientist roles.
